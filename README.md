# Pet Store Adoption Workflow

A multi-language pet adoption management system built with Motia, demonstrating CRUD operations, event-driven workflows, AI agent integration, and background processing across TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python implementations.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Complete implementations in TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python
- **Pet Management**: Full CRUD operations for pet records
- **Advanced Adoption Workflow**: Complex multi-step process with AI-powered decision making
- **Parallel Processing**: Background check and AI summarization run simultaneously
- **AI Agent Integration**: Three specialized agents for different workflow stages
- **Workflow Branching**: Intelligent routing (approve/reject/escalate) based on multiple criteria
- **Automated Scheduling**: Cron jobs for follow-up check-ins and maintenance (TypeScript only)
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: AI-powered pet matching with natural language reasons
- **Generative Summaries**: Automated application summaries with optional OpenAI enhancement
- **Language-Specific Event Isolation**: Each language has its own event namespace preventing cross-interference
- **Background Jobs**: Automated daily feeding reminders
- **File-based Storage**: JSON persistence across all implementations

## Architecture

### Workflow Organization

The system uses separate workflow definitions in `motia-workbench.json` for better organization:

- `"typescript-adoptions"` - Complete TypeScript adoption workflow
- `"javascript-adoptions"` - Complete JavaScript adoption workflow  
- `"python-adoptions"` - Complete Python adoption workflow
- `"pets"` - Shared pet management operations (CRUD, recommendations, daily jobs)

Each workflow definition includes:
- **Step Positioning**: Visual layout in Motia Workbench
- **Event Flow**: Connection between steps via handle positions
- **Language Isolation**: Complete separation of adoption workflows
- **Shared Resources**: Pet management steps available to all languages

### Enhanced Adoption Workflow
The system now implements a sophisticated, non-linear workflow with AI agents and parallel processing:

1. **Application Submission** - Submit adoption application via API with comprehensive validation
2. **Parallel Processing** - Two processes run simultaneously:
   - **Background Check** - Validates adopter history and pet availability
   - **AI Summarization** - Generates intelligent application summary
3. **Workflow Gateway** - Decision engine with three paths:
   - **Approve** ‚Üí Pet marked adopted, follow-up scheduled
   - **Reject** ‚Üí Recommender agent suggests alternative pets
   - **Escalate** ‚Üí Risk assessor evaluates confidence level
4. **AI Agents**:
   - **Application Summarizer** - Creates professional summaries
   - **Risk Assessor** - Evaluates adoption risk and confidence
   - **Recommender** - Suggests alternative pets with reasoning
5. **Automated Follow-up** - Cron jobs for:
   - 3-day check-in after adoption
   - 14-day wellness check
   - Stale application cleanup

### Language-Specific Workflow Isolation
Each language now has its own dedicated workflow in `motia-workbench.json`:

- **TypeScript**: `"typescript-adoptions"` workflow with `ts.adoption.*` events
- **JavaScript**: `"javascript-adoptions"` workflow with `js.adoption.*` events  
- **Python**: `"python-adoptions"` workflow with `py.adoption.*` events
- **General**: `"adoptions"` workflow for shared/legacy steps
- **Pet Management**: `"pets"` workflow for shared CRUD operations

**Complete Workflow Coverage:**
Each language now includes all workflow steps:
- API endpoint for application submission
- Parallel background check and AI summarization
- Workflow gateway for decision making (approve/reject/escalate)
- Post-decision actions (follow-up, recommendations, risk assessment)
- Automated cron jobs (TypeScript only for demonstration)

**Benefits:**
- Complete workflow isolation per language
- No cross-language event interference
- Each API endpoint triggers only its language-specific workflow
- Clean separation of concerns and easier debugging
- Individual workflow visualization in Motia Workbench
- Consistent workflow logic across all languages

## Testing Examples

### 1. Create Test Pets

**Note**: The system uses `ageMonths` internally but displays as years in responses.

#### TypeScript
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Buddy",
    "species": "dog",
    "breed": "Golden Retriever",
    "ageMonths": 36
  }'
```

#### JavaScript
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Whiskers",
    "species": "cat",
    "breed": "Persian",
    "ageMonths": 24
  }'
```

#### Python
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Charlie",
    "species": "dog",
    "breed": "Labrador",
    "ageMonths": 48
  }'
```

### 2. List All Pets

```bash
# TypeScript pets
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets

# JavaScript pets
curl http://localhost:3000/js/pets

# Python pets
curl http://localhost:3000/py/pets
```

### 3. Test Enhanced Adoption Workflow with AI Agents

The new adoption workflow demonstrates:
- **Parallel Processing**: Background check and AI summarization run simultaneously
- **Workflow Branching**: Approve, reject, or escalate based on intelligent decision-making
- **AI Agents**: Risk assessment, recommendations, and application summarization
- **Language Isolation**: Each language has its own complete workflow
- **Cron Jobs**: Automated follow-up check-ins and cleanup (TypeScript only)

#### Complete Workflow Testing

**Required Fields for All Applications:**
All adoption applications now require these fields:
- `petId` - ID of the pet to adopt
- `adopterName` - Name of the adopter (minimum 3 characters)
- `adopterEmail` - Email address (will be validated)

#### Successful Adoption Flow (TypeScript)
```bash
# First, get a pet ID from the list above, then:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "1",
    "adopterName": "John Smith",
    "adopterEmail": "john@example.com"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": 202,
  "body": {
    "applicationId": "app-1234567890",
    "message": "Application submitted for Buddy",
    "status": "processing"
  }
}
```

**Watch for Console Output (Complete Workflow):**
- `üìã Adoption application received` - Application submitted
- `üîç Running background check` - Parallel background validation
- `üìù Generating application summary` - Parallel AI summarization
- `‚öñÔ∏è Processing workflow decision input` - Waiting for both processes
- `üéØ Making workflow decision - both processes complete` - Decision gateway
- `üìß Sending adoption follow-up` - Follow-up for approved applications

**Workflow Progress:**
1. Application received and validated
2. Parallel processing: Background check + AI summarization
3. Decision gateway evaluates results
4. Appropriate action taken (approve/reject/escalate)
5. Follow-up scheduled for approved applications

#### Rejected Application with Recommendations (JavaScript)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "1",
    "adopterName": "Spam User",
    "adopterEmail": "spam@example.com"
  }'
```

**Expected Enhanced Behavior:**
- Background check fails due to "spam" in email
- AI summary still generated in parallel
- Workflow gateway decides to reject
- **Recommender agent** automatically suggests alternative pets
- Console shows rejection reason and alternative pet suggestions
- Only JavaScript workflow steps execute (language isolation maintained)

**Watch for New Console Output:**
- `ü§ñ Generating pet recommendations after rejection`
- Alternative pet suggestions with AI-powered reasons

#### Escalation Flow - Risk Assessment (Python)
```bash
# Create a senior pet first to trigger escalation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Senior Max",
    "species": "dog",
    "breed": "Golden Retriever",
    "ageMonths": 132
  }'

# Then apply for adoption
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "3",
    "adopterName": "Alice Johnson",
    "adopterEmail": "alice@example.com"
  }'
```

**Expected Escalation Behavior:**
- Background check passes
- AI summary generated
- Workflow gateway detects senior pet (11+ years)
- **Escalates to risk assessment agent**
- Risk assessor evaluates confidence level
- If confidence < threshold ‚Üí `needs_human` phase
- If confidence adequate ‚Üí conditional approval

**Watch for Risk Assessment Output:**
- `üîç Assessing adoption risk`
- Risk score calculation and confidence rating
- AI-enhanced assessment reasoning (if OpenAI key available)

#### Advanced Workflow Testing

**Test All Three Language Workflows:**
Each language now has a complete, isolated workflow. Test each one separately:

```bash
# TypeScript - Complete workflow with cron jobs
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "1",
    "adopterName": "TypeScript User",
    "adopterEmail": "ts@example.com"
  }'

# JavaScript - Complete workflow 
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "2", 
    "adopterName": "JavaScript User",
    "adopterEmail": "js@example.com"
  }'

# Python - Complete workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "3",
    "adopterName": "Python User", 
    "adopterEmail": "py@example.com"
  }'
```

**Verify Workflow Isolation:**
- Each language should trigger only its own workflow steps
- Check logs for language-specific prefixes: `Ts`, `Js`, `Py`
- Workbench should show three separate workflow executions
- No cross-language interference should occur

**Test Error Handling and Validation:**
```bash
# Missing required fields
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"petId": "1"}'
# Expected: 400 Bad Request

# Short adopter name (triggers escalation)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "1",
    "adopterName": "Jo",
    "adopterEmail": "short@example.com"
  }'
# Expected: Background check fails, rejection with recommendations

# Spam email (triggers rejection)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "1", 
    "adopterName": "Spam User",
    "adopterEmail": "spam@example.com"
  }'
# Expected: Background check fails, triggers recommender agent
```

**Test Cron Job Simulation (TypeScript Only):**
The system includes three automated cron jobs:
- `TsAdoptionCheckinDay3` - 3-day follow-up (runs at 10 AM daily)
- `TsAdoptionCheckinDay14` - 14-day follow-up (runs at 2 PM daily)  
- `TsStaleApplicationCleanup` - Cleanup old applications (runs at 2 AM daily)

**Test AI Enhancement (Optional):**
Set your OpenAI API key to see enhanced AI features:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

With AI enabled, you'll get:
- More engaging recommendation reasons
- Professional application summaries
- Enhanced risk assessment explanations

**Workbench Testing:**
1. Open Motia Workbench
2. Navigate to each workflow: `"typescript-adoptions"`, `"javascript-adoptions"`, `"python-adoptions"`
3. Submit applications and watch step execution
4. Verify each workflow runs independently
5. Monitor console logs for workflow progress

### 4. Test Pet Status Management

#### Valid Pet Status Values
```json
"available"  // Pet is available for adoption (default)
"pending"    // Pet has pending adoption application  
"adopted"    // Pet has been successfully adopted
```

#### Status Workflow Testing
```bash
# Make pet available for adoption
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "available"}'

# Mark pet as pending (simulates application submission)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/js/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "pending"}'

# Mark pet as adopted (simulates successful adoption)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/py/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "adopted"}'

# Verify status changes
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1
```

#### Update Multiple Pet Fields
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "species": "dog",
    "ageMonths": 24,
    "status": "available"
  }'
```

**Valid Species Values:** `"dog"`, `"cat"`, `"bird"`, `"other"`

### 5. Test Cross-Language Data Consistency

```bash
# Create pet via TypeScript
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Max", "species": "dog", "ageMonths": 60}'

# View same pet via JavaScript
curl http://localhost:3000/js/pets

# Update via Python
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/py/pets/2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "pending"}'

# Verify update via TypeScript
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/2
```

**Expected:** All languages share the same data store, so changes are visible across implementations.

### 6. Test Intelligent Pet Recommendations

#### Get Recommendations (TypeScript)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "species": "dog",
    "maxAge": 5,
    "breed": "Golden"
  }'
```

#### Get Recommendations (JavaScript)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "species": "cat",
    "maxAge": 3
  }'
```

#### Get Recommendations (Python)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "species": "dog",
    "minAge": 2,
    "maxAge": 6,
    "breed": "Labrador"
  }'
```


### 7. Test Edge Cases

#### Missing Required Fields
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "1"
  }'
# Expected: 400 Bad Request - Missing adopterName and adopterEmail
```

#### Non-existent Pet
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "invalid-pet-id",
    "adopterName": "Test User",
    "adopterEmail": "test@example.com"
  }'
# Expected: 404 Not Found
```

#### Pet Already Adopted
```bash
# First adopt a pet, then try to adopt the same pet again
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/adoptions/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "petId": "1",
    "adopterName": "Second Adopter",
    "adopterEmail": "second@example.com"
  }'
# Expected: 409 Conflict - Pet already adopted
```

## Background Jobs

### Daily Feeding Reminders
Automated cron jobs run daily to remind staff about pet feeding schedules:

- **TypeScript**: `jobs.feeding.daily.step.ts`
- **JavaScript**: `jobs.feeding.daily.step.js`  
- **Python**: `jobs_feeding_daily.step.py`

## Event Flow & Workflow

### Complete Adoption Process Events

1. **Application Submitted**
   - Events: `ts.adoption.applied` / `js.adoption.applied` / `py.adoption.applied`
   - Triggers parallel processing

2. **Background Check Completed**
   - Events: `ts.adoption.background.complete` / `js.adoption.background.complete` / `py.adoption.background.complete`
   - Contains validation results

3. **Application Summary Generated**
   - Events: `ts.adoption.summary.complete` / `js.adoption.summary.complete` / `py.adoption.summary.complete`
   - Contains AI-generated summary

4. **Decision Made**
   - Events: `ts.adoption.approved` / `js.adoption.approved` / `py.adoption.approved`
   - Or: `ts.adoption.rejected` / `js.adoption.rejected` / `py.adoption.rejected`
   - Or: `ts.adoption.escalate` / `js.adoption.escalate` / `py.adoption.escalate`

5. **Follow-up Sent** (for approved adoptions only)
   - Triggered by approval events
   - Final step in workflow

### Language Isolation Benefits
- **No Cross-Interference**: Python API only triggers Python events
- **Independent Scaling**: Each language can be scaled separately  
- **Easier Debugging**: Clear separation of language-specific issues
- **Clean Architecture**: Each implementation is self-contained

## Data Storage

All implementations use file-based JSON storage:

- **TypeScript**: `steps/typescript/ts-store.ts`
- **JavaScript**: `steps/javascript/js-store.js`
- **Python**: `steps/services/pet_store.py`

Data is persisted in JSON files and shared across language implementations for consistency.

## Monitoring & Logging

Each step includes comprehensive logging:
- Application submissions
- Background check results
- Adoption decisions
- Follow-up notifications

Check console output and structured logs for workflow execution details.

## Workbench Visualization

### Separate Workflow Views
The Motia workbench now displays individual workflows defined in `motia-workbench.json`:

#### TypeScript Adoption Workflow (`"typescript-adoptions"`)
- **Complete Flow**: Apply ‚Üí Parallel(Check + Summary) ‚Üí Decision Gateway ‚Üí Post-Decision Actions ‚Üí Follow-up
- **Includes**: All TypeScript-specific adoption steps and cron jobs
- **Events**: `ts.adoption.*` event namespace
- **Steps**: 10 total steps including 3 automated cron jobs
- **Visual Layout**: Comprehensive left-to-right flow with all workflow phases

#### JavaScript Adoption Workflow (`"javascript-adoptions"`)
- **Complete Flow**: Apply ‚Üí Parallel(Check + Summary) ‚Üí Decision Gateway ‚Üí Post-Decision Actions
- **Includes**: All JavaScript-specific adoption steps  
- **Events**: `js.adoption.*` event namespace
- **Steps**: 7 total steps covering complete adoption workflow
- **Visual Layout**: Clean workflow layout with parallel processing branches

#### Python Adoption Workflow (`"python-adoptions"`)
- **Complete Flow**: Apply ‚Üí Parallel(Check + Summary) ‚Üí Decision Gateway ‚Üí Post-Decision Actions
- **Includes**: All Python-specific adoption steps
- **Events**: `py.adoption.*` event namespace
- **Steps**: 7 total steps covering complete adoption workflow
- **Visual Layout**: Consistent structure matching other language workflows

#### General Adoption Workflow (`"adoptions"`)
- **Legacy Support**: Contains some shared/legacy adoption steps
- **Events**: Mixed event namespaces
- **Purpose**: Maintains compatibility with existing configurations

#### Pet Management Workflow (`"pets"`)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete pets across all languages
- **Recommendations**: AI-powered pet matching
- **Daily Maintenance**: Feeding reminder cron jobs
- **Visual Layout**: Shared operations available to all adoption workflows

### Workflow Features
- **Individual Workflow Execution**: Watch language-specific workflows in isolation
- **Event Tracing**: Track events within each workflow boundary
- **Cross-Language Data**: Shared pet data store across all workflows
- **AI Integration**: Monitor agent decision-making processes

## AI Enhancement

### OpenAI Integration

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to enable AI-powered features:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**AI-Enhanced Features:**
- **Recommendation Reasons**: More engaging and personalized pet match explanations
- **Application Summaries**: Professional, friendly summaries of adoption applications

**Without API Key:**
- System uses deterministic, rule-based reasoning
- All functionality works normally with basic text generation

### Recommendation Algorithm

**Scoring System:**
- Species match: +40 points
- Age within range: +20 points each (min/max)
- Breed match: +15 points
- Available status: +5 points
- Maximum score: 100 points

**Preference Options:**
- `species`: "dog", "cat", etc.
- `maxAge`: Maximum age preference
- `minAge`: Minimum age preference  
- `breed`: Breed name (partial matching)

## Workflow Architecture & Testing

### Complete Workflow Coverage

Each language implementation now includes the full adoption workflow:

#### 1. **Application Phase**
- **API Endpoint**: Receives and validates adoption applications
- **Required Fields**: `petId`, `adopterName`, `adopterEmail`
- **Response**: Simple JSON confirmation with application ID
- **Event Emission**: Triggers parallel processing

#### 2. **Parallel Processing Phase**
- **Background Check**: Validates adopter history, pet availability, email patterns
- **AI Summarization**: Generates intelligent application summaries
- **Synchronization**: Workflow gateway waits for both processes to complete
- **Console Logging**: Shows progress during parallel execution

#### 3. **Decision Gateway Phase**
- **Three-Path Logic**: Approve, Reject, or Escalate
- **Decision Criteria**:
  - **Approve**: All checks pass, no risk factors detected
  - **Reject**: Background check fails, invalid data detected
  - **Escalate**: Senior pets, exotic species, concerning summary content
- **Random Escalation**: 10% chance for quality assurance demonstration

#### 4. **Post-Decision Actions**
- **Approved**: Pet marked adopted, follow-up scheduled
- **Rejected**: Recommender agent suggests alternative pets
- **Escalated**: Risk assessor evaluates confidence level

#### 5. **Follow-up & Maintenance** (TypeScript Only)
- **3-Day Check-in**: Automated cron job for early adoption support
- **14-Day Check-in**: Wellness check and milestone verification
- **Cleanup Jobs**: Stale application management

### Testing Strategy

#### **Isolation Testing**
Test each language workflow independently:
```bash
# Each should trigger only its own language-specific steps
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/adoptions/apply -d '{"petId":"1","adopterName":"TS Test","adopterEmail":"ts@test.com"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/adoptions/apply -d '{"petId":"2","adopterName":"JS Test","adopterEmail":"js@test.com"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/adoptions/apply -d '{"petId":"3","adopterName":"PY Test","adopterEmail":"py@test.com"}'
```

#### **Parallel Processing Testing**
Watch logs to verify simultaneous execution:
- Background check and AI summarization should start at nearly the same time
- Decision gateway should wait for both to complete
- Look for "Waiting for parallel processes" message

#### **Decision Path Testing**
Force different decision paths:
```bash
# Force rejection with spam email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/adoptions/apply -d '{"petId":"1","adopterName":"Test","adopterEmail":"spam@test.com"}'

# Force escalation with short name  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/adoptions/apply -d '{"petId":"1","adopterName":"Jo","adopterEmail":"short@test.com"}'

# Normal approval path
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/adoptions/apply -d '{"petId":"1","adopterName":"John Smith","adopterEmail":"john@test.com"}'
```

#### **Console Monitoring**
Monitor workflow execution:
1. Open terminal running Motia
2. Watch console logs for workflow progress
3. Verify event flow and decision-making
4. Check for proper language isolation

#### **Workbench Verification**
Visual workflow verification:
1. Each language should have its own workflow tab
2. Steps should execute in proper sequence
3. Parallel steps should show simultaneous execution
4. Decision gateway should show branching logic
5. No cross-language step execution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pet not found**: Ensure you're using a valid pet ID from the GET /pets response
2. **Import errors**: Check that all service files are properly structured
3. **Event not triggering**: Verify that event names match between emitters and subscribers
4. **Cross-language interference**: Each language uses isolated event namespaces
5. **AI features not working**: Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set correctly

### Validation Rules

#### Pet Data Validation
- **Pet names**: Must be non-empty strings
- **Pet species**: Must be one of: `"dog"`, `"cat"`, `"bird"`, `"other"`
- **Pet age**: `ageMonths` must be a positive number
- **Pet status**: Must be one of: `"available"`, `"pending"`, `"adopted"`

#### Adoption Validation
- **Adopter names**: Must be longer than 2 characters
- **Adopter emails**: Cannot contain "spam"
- **Pet availability**: Pet status must be "available" to start adoption process
- **Recommendations**: At least one preference must be provided

#### API Behavior
- ‚úÖ Invalid field values are ignored (not applied to pet)
- ‚úÖ Only valid fields are updated
- ‚úÖ Returns 404 if pet ID doesn't exist
- ‚úÖ Returns 200 with updated pet data on success

## Development

To extend the system:
1. Add new steps with proper `flows: ['pets']` configuration
2. Use language-specific event names to maintain isolation
3. Include comprehensive error handling and logging
4. Update workbench positioning for new steps
