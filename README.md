## 📖 Level 1: API Endpoints - Basic CRUD

The foundation of our system is a RESTful API for pet management. This level demonstrates basic API design, validation, and data persistence.

### API Endpoints

All three languages provide identical CRUD functionality:

#### TypeScript Endpoints (`/ts/pets`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/ts/pets` | Create a new pet |
| GET | `/ts/pets` | List all pets |
| GET | `/ts/pets/:id` | Get pet by ID |
| PUT | `/ts/pets/:id` | Update pet |
| DELETE | `/ts/pets/:id` | Soft delete pet |

#### JavaScript Endpoints (`/js/pets`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/js/pets` | Create a new pet |
| GET | `/js/pets` | List all pets |
| GET | `/js/pets/:id` | Get pet by ID |
| PUT | `/js/pets/:id` | Update pet |
| DELETE | `/js/pets/:id` | Soft delete pet |

#### Python Endpoints (`/py/pets`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/py/pets` | Create a new pet |
| GET | `/py/pets` | List all pets |
| GET | `/py/pets/:id` | Get pet by ID |
| PUT | `/py/pets/:id` | Update pet |
| DELETE | `/py/pets/:id` | Soft delete pet |

### Pet Data Model

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "Buddy",
  "species": "dog",
  "ageMonths": 24,
  "status": "new",
  "createdAt": 1640995200000,
  "updatedAt": 1640995200000,
  "weightKg": 15.5,
  "symptoms": ["coughing", "lethargy"],
  "notes": "Welcome to our pet store!",
  "nextFeedingAt": 1641081600000,
  "deletedAt": null,
  "purgeAt": null,
  "profile": {
    "bio": "Buddy is a friendly and energetic golden retriever...",
    "breedGuess": "Golden Retriever Mix",
    "temperamentTags": ["friendly", "energetic", "loyal"],
    "adopterHints": "Perfect for active families..."
  }
}
```

### Testing Level 1

```bash
# Create a pet
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Buddy",
    "species": "dog",
    "ageMonths": 24
  }'

# List all pets
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets

# Get specific pet
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1

# Update pet
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ageMonths": 25}'

# Soft delete pet
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1
```

---

## 📖 Level 2: Background Jobs - Async Processing

Building on Level 1, we add asynchronous background processing to handle time-consuming tasks without blocking API responses.

### Queue-Based Job: SetNextFeedingReminder

**Triggered by**: Creating a pet via any `POST /*/pets` endpoint

**Purpose**: Sets next feeding reminder and adds welcome notes after pet creation

**Process**:
1. Pet creation API completes immediately with `status: 201`
2. API emits language-specific event (e.g., `ts.feeding.reminder.enqueued`)
3. Background job picks up the event and processes asynchronously
4. Job adds welcome notes, calculates next feeding time, and sets status to `in_quarantine`
5. Job emits completion event with processing metrics

**Console Output**:
```
🐾 Pet created { petId: '1', name: 'Buddy', species: 'dog', status: 'new' }
🔄 Setting next feeding reminder { petId: '1', enqueuedAt: 1640995200000 }
✅ Next feeding reminder set { petId: '1', notes: 'Welcome to our pet store!...', nextFeedingAt: '2022-01-02T00:00:00.000Z' }
```

### Cron-Based Job: Deletion Reaper

**Schedule**: Daily at 2:00 AM (`0 2 * * *`)

**Purpose**: Permanently removes pets that have been soft deleted and are past their purge date

**Process**:
1. Scans for pets with `status="deleted"` and `purgeAt <= now`
2. Permanently removes matching pets from the datastore
3. Emits audit events for each purged pet
4. Reports completion statistics

**Console Output**:
```
🔄 Deletion Reaper started - scanning for pets to purge
💀 Pet permanently purged { petId: '1', name: 'Buddy', deletedAt: '2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z', purgeAt: '2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z' }
✅ Deletion Reaper completed { totalScanned: 5, purgedCount: 2, failedCount: 0 }
```

### Testing Level 2

```bash
# Create a pet and watch console for background job processing
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Whiskers", "species": "cat", "ageMonths": 12}'

# Check pet record after job completion (wait a few seconds)
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1

# Test soft delete
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1

# Verify pet is marked as deleted but still exists
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1
```

## 📖 Level 3: Workflow Orchestrator - Centralized State Management

Level 3 introduces a Pet Lifecycle Orchestrator that manages all status transitions through a realistic shelter workflow with guard enforcement.

### Core Architecture

**Centralized Control**: Only the orchestrator can modify `pet.status`. All other components emit events.

**Staff-Driven Workflow**: Status changes require staff decisions through the existing PUT API.

**Event-Driven**: Orchestrator subscribes to domain events and validates transition rules.

**Language Isolation**: Each language has its own orchestrator with language-specific event namespaces.

### Pet Lifecycle States

- `new` - Initial status when pet is created
- `in_quarantine` - Pet is in quarantine after feeding reminder setup
- `healthy` - Pet is healthy and cleared from quarantine
- `available` - Pet is ready for adoption
- `pending` - Adoption application in progress
- `adopted` - Pet has been adopted
- `ill` - Pet is identified as ill
- `under_treatment` - Pet is receiving medical treatment
- `recovered` - Pet has recovered from illness
- `deleted` - Pet is soft deleted (outside orchestrator)

### Transition Rules

| Trigger Event | From Status | To Status | Action Type |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `feeding.reminder.completed` | `new` | `in_quarantine` | **Automatic** |
| `status.update.requested` | `in_quarantine` | `healthy` | **Staff Decision** |
| `status.update.requested` | `healthy` | `available` | **Automatic Progression** |
| `status.update.requested` | `healthy`, `in_quarantine`, `available` | `ill` | **Staff Assessment** |
| `status.update.requested` | `ill` | `under_treatment` | **Automatic Progression** |
| `status.update.requested` | `under_treatment` | `recovered` | **Staff Decision** |
| `status.update.requested` | `recovered` | `healthy` | **Automatic Progression** |
| `status.update.requested` | `available` | `pending` | **Staff Decision** |
| `status.update.requested` | `pending` | `adopted` | **Staff Decision** |

### Workflow Flow

```
POST /pets → new
↓ (SetNextFeedingReminder completes - automatic)
in_quarantine
↓ (Staff health check via PUT API)
healthy
↓ (AUTOMATIC - orchestrator progression)
available
↓ (Staff adoption process via PUT API)
pending → adopted

Illness Can Happen Anytime:
in_quarantine → ill (Staff finds illness)
healthy → ill (Staff assessment)
available → ill (Staff discovers illness)
↓ (AUTOMATIC - orchestrator starts treatment)
under_treatment
↓ (Staff marks recovered via PUT API)
recovered
↓ (AUTOMATIC - orchestrator clears recovery)
healthy
↓ (AUTOMATIC - orchestrator marks ready)
available
```

### Testing Level 3

```bash
# 1. Create a pet - starts with status=new, automatically moves to in_quarantine
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Buddy", "species": "dog", "ageMonths": 24}'

# 2. Check current status (should be in_quarantine after feeding reminder)
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1

# 3. Staff health check - clear from quarantine to healthy
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "healthy"}'

# 4. Check status (should be available - automatic progression)
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1

# 5. Mark as ill
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "ill"}'

# 6. Check status (should be under_treatment - automatic progression)
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1
```

## 📖 Level 4: AI Agents - Intelligent Decision Making

Level 4 introduces AI-powered agents that make intelligent decisions based on pet context using OpenAI.

### Three Types of AI Agents

#### 1. AI Profile Enrichment (Non-Routing)

**Trigger**: Automatic on `pet.created` event

**Purpose**: Generate detailed pet profiles using AI

**AI-Generated Fields**:
- `bio` - Warm, engaging 2-3 sentence description
- `breedGuess` - AI's best guess at breed or breed mix
- `temperamentTags` - Array of 3-5 personality traits
- `adopterHints` - Practical advice for potential adopters

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "profile": {
    "bio": "Luna is a graceful and independent cat with striking green eyes who enjoys sunny windowsills and gentle head scratches.",
    "breedGuess": "Domestic Shorthair",
    "temperamentTags": ["independent", "calm", "affectionate", "observant"],
    "adopterHints": "Ideal for singles or couples seeking a low-maintenance companion. Prefers quiet environments."
  }
}
```

#### 2. Health Review Agent (Routing)

**Endpoint**: `POST /ts/pets/:id/health-review`

**Purpose**: AI evaluates pet health and chooses appropriate action

**Available Decisions**:
- `emit.health.treatment_required` → Pet needs medical treatment
- `emit.health.no_treatment_needed` → Pet is healthy

**Decision Process**:
1. Analyze pet symptoms, age, species, current status
2. LLM chooses appropriate emit based on context
3. Provides structured rationale for decision
4. Orchestrator consumes emit and applies transitions

#### 3. Adoption Review Agent (Routing)

**Endpoint**: `POST /ts/pets/:id/adoption-review`

**Purpose**: AI evaluates adoption readiness

**Available Decisions**:
- `emit.adoption.needs_data` → Pet needs additional data
- `emit.adoption.ready` → Pet is ready for adoption

**Decision Artifact**:
```json
{
  "petId": "1",
  "agentType": "health-review",
  "timestamp": 1640995200000,
  "parsedDecision": {
    "chosenEmit": "emit.health.treatment_required",
    "rationale": "Pet shows concerning symptoms of coughing and lethargy that require veterinary evaluation."
  },
  "success": true
}
```

### Testing Level 4

```bash
# Test AI Profile Enrichment (automatic)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Luna", "species": "cat", "ageMonths": 18}'

# Wait 2-3 seconds, then check for AI-generated profile
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1

# Test Health Review Agent with symptoms
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Max",
    "species": "dog",
    "ageMonths": 36,
    "symptoms": ["coughing", "lethargy", "fever"]
  }'

# Trigger health review
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/2/health-review

# Test Adoption Review Agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1/adoption-review
```

## 📖 Level 5: Streaming AI Agents ⭐ - Real-Time Updates

**The Final Level**: Building on all previous levels, we add real-time streaming to provide immediate user feedback while background processes execute.

### What is Streaming?

Traditional APIs return a single response after all processing completes. With **Motia's native Streams API**, your API can return immediately with a stream that updates in real-time as background jobs, AI agents, and orchestrators process asynchronously.

### Stream Configuration

The streaming feature is defined in `pet-creation.stream.ts`:

```typescript
import { StreamConfig } from 'motia'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const config: StreamConfig = {
  name: 'petCreation',
  schema: z.object({ 
    message: z.string()
  }),
  baseConfig: {
    storageType: 'default',
  },
}
```

This stream is available as `context.streams.petCreation` in all steps within the flow.

### How Streaming Works

#### 1. API Initializes Stream

```typescript
// create-pet.step.ts
const result = await streams.petCreation.set(traceId, 'message', { 
  message: `Pet ${pet.name} (ID: ${pet.id}) created successfully` 
});

return { 
  status: 201, 
  body: result  // Returns stream immediately
};
```

#### 2. Background Jobs Update Stream

```typescript
// set-next-feeding-reminder.job.step.ts
await streams.petCreation.set(traceId, 'message', { 
  message: `Pet ${pet.name} entered quarantine period` 
});

await streams.petCreation.set(traceId, 'message', { 
  message: `Health check passed for ${pet.name} - no symptoms found` 
});

await streams.petCreation.set(traceId, 'message', { 
  message: `${pet.name} is healthy and ready for adoption! ✅` 
});
```

#### 3. AI Enrichment Streams Progress

```typescript
// ai-profile-enrichment.step.ts
await streams.petCreation.set(traceId, 'enrichment_started', { 
  message: `AI enrichment started for ${pet.name}` 
});

await streams.petCreation.set(traceId, `progress_bio`, { 
  message: `Generated bio for ${pet.name}` 
});

await streams.petCreation.set(traceId, 'completed', { 
  message: `AI enrichment completed for ${pet.name}`,
  profile: generatedProfile
});
```

#### 4. Orchestrator Streams Transitions

```typescript
// pet-lifecycle-orchestrator.step.ts
await streams.petCreation.set(traceId, transitionTo, {
  message: `Status transition: ${currentStatus} → ${transitionTo}`,
  petId,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

### Real-Time Stream Response

When you create a pet, the API returns a stream object immediately:

```json
{
  "streamId": "trace-abc123",
  "updates": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "timestamp": 1640995200000,
      "data": {
        "message": "Pet Buddy (ID: 1) created successfully - Species: dog, Age: 24 months, Status: new"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

As background jobs execute, the stream receives real-time updates:

```json
{
  "streamId": "trace-abc123",
  "updates": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "timestamp": 1640995200000,
      "data": { "message": "Pet Buddy (ID: 1) created successfully..." }
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "timestamp": 1640995201500,
      "data": { "message": "Pet Buddy entered quarantine period" }
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "timestamp": 1640995203000,
      "data": { "message": "Health check passed for Buddy - no symptoms found" }
    },
    {
      "type": "enrichment_started",
      "timestamp": 1640995201000,
      "data": { "message": "AI enrichment started for Buddy" }
    },
    {
      "type": "progress_bio",
      "timestamp": 1640995202500,
      "data": { "message": "Generated bio for Buddy" }
    },
    {
      "type": "completed",
      "timestamp": 1640995204000,
      "data": { 
        "message": "AI enrichment completed for Buddy",
        "profile": { "bio": "...", "breedGuess": "...", ... }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "timestamp": 1640995205000,
      "data": { "message": "Buddy is healthy and ready for adoption! ✅" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Testing Level 5 - Streaming

#### Test 1: Basic Streaming (Healthy Pet)

```bash
# Create a healthy pet without symptoms
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Luna",
    "species": "cat",
    "ageMonths": 18
  }'
```

**Expected Stream Updates**:
1. ✅ "Pet Luna (ID: X) created successfully"
2. 🔄 "Pet Luna entered quarantine period"
3. 🤖 "AI enrichment started for Luna"
4. 📝 "Generated bio for Luna"
5. 📝 "Generated breed guess for Luna"
6. ✅ "AI enrichment completed for Luna"
7. ✅ "Health check passed for Luna - no symptoms found"
8. ✅ "Luna is healthy and ready for adoption! ✅"

#### Test 2: Streaming with Symptoms (Sick Pet)

```bash
# Create a pet with symptoms
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Max",
    "species": "dog",
    "ageMonths": 36,
    "symptoms": ["coughing", "lethargy", "fever"],
    "weightKg": 25.5
  }'
```

**Expected Stream Updates**:
1. ✅ "Pet Max (ID: X) created successfully"
2. 🔄 "Pet Max entered quarantine period"
3. 🤖 "AI enrichment started for Max"
4. 📝 AI profile generation progress updates
5. ✅ "AI enrichment completed for Max"
6. ⚠️ "Health check failed for Max - symptoms detected: coughing, lethargy, fever"
7. ❌ "Max needs medical treatment ❌"

#### Test 3: Monitor Stream in Real-Time

You can also fetch the stream directly to see updates:

```bash
# Get stream updates (replace STREAM_ID with actual streamId from response)
curl http://localhost:3000/streams/STREAM_ID
```

### Benefits of Streaming

| Traditional API | Streaming API |
|----------------|---------------|
| ⏳ Wait for all processing | ✅ Immediate response |
| 🤷 No progress visibility | 📊 Real-time progress updates |
| ❌ Timeout on long operations | ✅ No timeout issues |

## 🎓 Complete Tutorial Walkthrough

Follow this step-by-step guide to experience all 5 levels in sequence:

### Step 1: Basic Pet Creation (Levels 1-2)

```bash
# Create a healthy pet
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Buddy", "species": "dog", "ageMonths": 24}'

# Expected: Immediate API response with stream
# Expected: Background job processes feeding reminder (watch console)
# Expected: AI enrichment generates profile (watch console)
```

### Step 2: Verify Streaming Updates (Level 5)

```bash
# Get the pet to see final state
curl http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1

# Expected: Pet with status "available", complete profile, notes, nextFeedingAt
```

### Step 3: Test Orchestrator (Level 3)

```bash
# Try invalid transition
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "adopted"}'

# Expected: Transition rejected (can't go directly from available to adopted)

# Valid transition: pending adoption
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "pending"}'

# Valid transition: complete adoption
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "adopted"}'
```

### Step 4: Test AI Health Review (Level 4)

```bash
# Create a pet with symptoms
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Max",
    "species": "dog",
    "ageMonths": 36,
    "symptoms": ["coughing", "lethargy", "fever"],
    "weightKg": 25.5
  }'

# Wait for pet to reach "healthy" or "available" status
# Then trigger AI health review
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/2/health-review

# Expected: AI agent chooses "treatment_required"
# Expected: Orchestrator automatically transitions: healthy → ill → under_treatment
```

### Step 5: Test AI Adoption Review (Level 4)

```bash
# Trigger adoption review on available pet
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ts/pets/2/adoption-review

# Expected: AI agent evaluates readiness
# Expected: Decision artifact with rationale
```

### Step 6: Test Multi-Language Parity

```bash
# Test JavaScript implementation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "JS_Pet", "species": "cat", "ageMonths": 12}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/js/pets/1/health-review

# Test Python implementation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/pets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Py_Pet", "species": "bird", "ageMonths": 6}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/py/pets/1/health-review

# Expected: Identical behavior across all three languages
```
